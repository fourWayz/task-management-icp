## Introduction

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) provides a robust platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). In this article, we will create a decentralized task management system on ICP. This system allows users to create, update, complete, and delete tasks. Additionally, it ensures authorization checks, ensuring only the task owner can modify or delete their tasks.

## Overview of the System

This decentralized task management system offers the following features:

- **Task Creation:** Users can create tasks with a title, description, and reward.
- **Task Retrieval:** Retrieve all tasks, tasks by specific criteria (e.g., assigned user or status), or individual tasks by ID.
- **Task Updates:** Modify task details, mark tasks as completed, or assign them to users.
- **Task Deletion:** Remove tasks securely with proper authorization checks.
- **Authorization:** Only task owners can modify or delete their tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Installed on your system.
- **Azle Framework**: A JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for developing on ICP.
- **UUID Library**: For generating unique task identifiers.
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and blockchain concepts.
